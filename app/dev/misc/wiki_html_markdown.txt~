# Smooth Clicker
_A free open-source easy to use material-designed autoclicker for Android rooted devices._

This app can trigger software clicks thanks to system Shell commands executed as SU.
The app is open-source, easy to use and to configure and can make several clicks with delayed starts and pauses between each click.
You can also repeat clicks sequences and make infinite clicks loops.

**Be aware this app is still in development and your device must be rooted**
