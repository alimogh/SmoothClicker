# Smooth Clicker
[Android] Project of an Android app which can trigger software clicks thanks to system Shell commands executed as SU.

This app is quite similar as apps which can be found on the Google Play, but this one is open-source (!) and under Apache v2 Licence.

<b>This app is still in development, some features should be added.</b>
<b>Keep in mind your device has to be rooted</b>
